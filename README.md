# Drip Time


This is a sample application. It contains three models:

1. Exporter
2. Insurance
3. Analytic

### Problem Statement
* Add a feature to track creation, deletion and changes inside the models' objects.   
* For instance, an `Exporter` should create an entry and full snapshot of all it's values when it's created.
```ruby
e = Exporter.create(name: 'Ankur', email: 'foobar@foobar.com', password: 'foobar', password_confirmation: 'foobar')
e.reload.archived #=> [one ArchivedExporter object] [1]
e.archived.first.model_action #=> create
e.update_attribute :name, 'FooBar'
e.reload.archived #=> [two or more ArchivedExporter objects] [2]
e.archived.last.model_action #=> update
e.password = e.password_confirmation = 'newpassword'; e.save
e.reload.archived #=> should be same as [2]
e.destroy
e.archived.reload.last.action #=> 'destroy'
```
* By _full snaphot_, we mean that object should contain all the attributes of the object at that point of time. 
* `Exporter` and `Insurance` attributes need to be tracked. Name of attributes to be tracked is mentioned in models. `Analytic` does not need to be tracked.
* API should be flexible, we should be able to control what attributes we want to track.

### Good to have
* If new columns are added, existing columns are removed, think and implement/suggest how your solution will adopt.
* How does your solution scale when new models are added?
* Optimizations thinking Ruby/Rails and performance in point of view.   

### Submission
* Clone this project and submit your solution as a **zip** file.
* Mention additional `rails` / `rake` commands which are necessary to support your changes.
* Example snippets like above should work.
* If you wish, you can also add submission notes below discussing your approach and challenges faced.
